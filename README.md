## Meta

From this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JN4RI7nkes).

Update/Change the state population data by putting your own data into [state-populations.csv](https://github.com/k-donn/ec-apportionment/blob/master/data/state-populations.csv) or pass the new name of the file from the command line.

The CSV file should not have a header.
